## Overview ##

This project will be an introduction to configuration management with Ansible. We will first create a cloud server using Terraform, then we will configure that VM to be a webserver. This project assumes you have already followed the instructions detailed in [Intro-to-DigitalOcean](https://github.com/IaC-Unleashed/Intro-to-DigitalOcean), except do not destroy the virtual machine at the end. If you have, simply spin up another one!
